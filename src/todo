make equivalence command apply to all pairwise comparisons
permit auto trimming of pdb files for molecular replacement
keep names of pdb files throughout
multiple matrices for multiple rigid subdomains
eliminate parse.o
eliminate needless functions in path_mat.cxx
move scoring stuff from path_mat.cxx to ???score.cxx
need to know to update table when epen and gpen are changed (or do you?)
IMPLEMENT RICH SEQUENCE FILE FORMAT
make TRIM command to keep only conserved parts
make SELECT command to apply to TRIM and SPLIT
make STRUCT1 part of SEQ1 etc.
daughter windows should get stopwatches too
statistics on angular rms as well as distance rms
residue numbers in strucstats
molecule name in selection
fancy numbering in file output (and input)
euler angles for rotations

- Debug molecule display on satan

- put up stopwatch during file read

- output hinge axis and angle on command

- print more statistics during multiple structure overlays

- include orientation info in equiv

- make "!" things go to X window in X window version 

- consensus of "X" plus "X" is now "a" (should be "X")

- matrix browser for debugging

- carefully check RANDOM command

- put pedantic checking on dimensions of vector/matrix operations

- make all column_attribute, row_attribute calls consistent

- implement print pam etc.

- implement delta statistics in random command

- Sanity checking for which steps have already been performed

- Residue dependent gap penalties

- Permit gaps more easily in places with gaps

- Residue dependent weighting

- Three-way alignments

- Automatic "pileup"-like alignment

- Reorder sequences based upon similarity
 
- Generate phylogenetic trees

- variables and loops
